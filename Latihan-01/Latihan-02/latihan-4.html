  <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h1>
  <p>There's no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The U.S.Bureauof Labor Statistics projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028.which is more than four times the average for all occupations.What's more,the medianannual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times themedian pay for all U.S. workers.</p>  
  <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles,companies,and types ofsoftware require knowing and understanding different programming languages-and it'soften beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of softwareprogramming can be a daunting experience,especially for professionals with no priorprogramming experience.</p>
  <p>The <u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u> at Northeastern University isspecifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from anotherfield of study.</p>
  <p><em>"Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have themcome out as software engineers,”</em> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduatecomputer science programs at Northeastern University-Seattle.<em>“We focus on math,programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts."</em></p>
  <p>Whether you're new to-programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to knolanguages are in high demand.Here are 10 of the most popular programminglanguages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed,the
    average annual slary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for
    growth.</p>
